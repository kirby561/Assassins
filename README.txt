This is a server for an in-person game I'm tentatively called "Assassins".

The Game
---------
Everyone will join a server with their phone.  Each player will have a picture of what they currently look like registered with the server.
The goal is to get the most kills in some amount of time (Or first to N kills).  You get points by assassinating a target that's given to you.
Assassinations are registered with the phone app that everyone is using.  Your target is assigned to you by the server and is displayed on your phone.
It will also use GPS to point towards approximately where your target is.  How exactly to assassinate your target may be game dependent (Shoot with nerf gun, stab with rubber knife, stab with real knife, whatever your friends are into...).
Kills will be reported to the server by the app as well.  When you assassinate someone, you indicate that you killed your target and a new one is assigned to you.
It may need the target to confirm they have been killed.  Depends how much you trust your friends.

The idea is you would play it in a crowded place (like a renaissance fair).  This would allow you to be sneaky and blend into the crowd.  This wouldn't be much fun in an open field.

In any case, I wanted to try out rust and this is my excuse.
